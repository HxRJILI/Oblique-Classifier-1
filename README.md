# Oblique Classifier 1 (OC1) Implementation

An open-source implementation of the Oblique Classifier 1 (OC1) decision tree algorithm (Murthy, Kasif, Salzberg 1994).

## Project Description

This repository is a team effort to rebuild and implement the classic OC1 machine learning algorithm from scratch. The OC1 system is designed to induce decision trees that use linear combinations of attributes (oblique hyperplanes) to partition the data space, often resulting in smaller and more accurate trees than traditional axis-parallel methods (like C4.5 or CART) in specific domains.

Our goal is to create a robust, well-tested, and easy-to-use Python package (or whichever language you have choosen).
